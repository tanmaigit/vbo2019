When testing with WordPress theme and plugins detector services/sites, any setting change may not reflect right away on their reports, since they use cache. So you may want to check again later, or try a different inner url, homepage url usage is not mandatory.

Being the best content management system, widely used, WordPress is susceptible to a large range of hacking attacks including brute-force, SQL injections, XSS, XSRF etc. Despite the fact the WordPress core is a very secure code maintained by a team of professional enthusiast, the additional plugins and themes makes the vulnerable spot of every website. In many cases, those are created by pseudo-developers who do not follow the best coding practices or simply do not own the experience to create a secure plugin. 
Statistics reveal that every day new vulnerabilities are discovered, many affecting hundreds of thousands of WordPress websites. 
Over 99,9% of hacked WordPress websites are target of automated malware scripts, who search for certain WordPress fingerprints. This plugin hide or replace those traces, making the hacking boots attacks useless.

Works fine with custom WordPress directory structures e.g. custom plugins, themes, uplaods folder.

Once configured, you need to **clear server cache data and/or any cache plugins** (e.g. W3 Cache), for a new html data to be created. If use CDN this should be cache clear as well.

**Sample usage**
[vimeo https://vimeo.com/192011678]

**Main plugin functionality:**

* Custom Admin Url
* Block default admin Url
* Block any direct folder access to completely hide the structure

* Block default wp-signup.php
* Block XML-RPC API
* New XML-RPC path

and many more.

**No other plugins functionality is being blocked or interfered in any way, everything will function the same**

This plugin allow to change default Admin Url's from **wp-login.php** and **wp-admin** to something else. All original links return default theme 404 Not Found page, like nothing exists there. Beside the huge security advantage, this save lots of server processing time by reducing php code and MySQL usage since brute-force attacks trigger wrong urls.

**Important:** Compared to all other similar plugins which mainly use redirects, this plugin return a default theme 404 error page for all **block url** functionality, so is not revealing at all the link existence.

Since version 1.2 Change individual plugin urls which make them unrecognizable, for example change default WooCommerce plugin urls and dependencies from domain.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/ to domain.com/ecommerce/cdn/ or anything customized.
